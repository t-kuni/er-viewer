# Sidebar Resize Functionality Test Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the test coverage for sidebar resize functionality in the ER Viewer application.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `sidebar-resize-functionality.test.js`
Basic unit tests for sidebar resize behavior:
- ✅ Start sidebar resize when clicking on resize handle
- ✅ Resize sidebar within min/max bounds during drag (200px - 600px)
- ✅ End resize and save width to localStorage
- ✅ Prevent resize if not clicking on resize handle
- ✅ Handle case when resize not started
- ✅ Support multiple resize sessions
- ✅ Maintain sidebar state during resize
- ✅ Handle edge case of very fast mouse movements
- ✅ Apply visual feedback during resize (dragging class, cursor change)

### 2. `sidebar-resize-integration.test.js`
Integration tests with EventController:
- ✅ Integrate sidebar resize with EventController event flow
- ✅ Handle sidebar resize through complete event cycle
- ✅ Not interfere with other interaction modes
- ✅ Handle sidebar resize with boundary constraints
- ✅ Restore sidebar width from localStorage on initialization
- ✅ Handle rapid mouse movements during resize
- ✅ Properly clean up after resize cancellation (ESC key)

## Implementation Details

### CSS Support
The application already has CSS classes defined for sidebar resize:
- `.sidebar-resize-handle` - The draggable resize handle
- `.sidebar-resize-handle:hover` - Hover state
- `.sidebar-resize-handle.dragging` - Active dragging state

### Event Handling Pattern
The tests demonstrate how to integrate sidebar resize with the existing EventController:
1. Register a mousedown handler for `.sidebar-resize-handle`
2. Track resize state in the StateManager with `resizing-sidebar` interaction mode
3. Handle mousemove events to update sidebar width
4. Handle mouseup events to complete the resize
5. Support ESC key to cancel resize operation

### Constraints
- Minimum width: 200px
- Maximum width: 600px
- Width persistence using localStorage

## Test Results
All tests pass successfully, demonstrating that the sidebar resize functionality can be cleanly integrated into the existing architecture without breaking other features.

## Integration Notes
To fully implement this feature in production:
1. Add the resize handle element to the sidebar HTML if not present
2. Register the sidebar resize handlers in EventController
3. Add the resize interaction mode handling to the mousemove/mouseup event flow
4. Implement localStorage persistence for user preferences
